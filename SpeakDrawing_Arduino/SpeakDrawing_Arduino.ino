 * ShiftPWM blocking RGB fades example, (c) Elco Jacobs, updated August 2012.
 *
 * ShiftPWM blocking RGB fades example. This example uses simple delay loops to create fades.
 * If you want to change the fading mode based on inputs (sensors, buttons, serial), use the non-blocking example as a starting point.
 * Please go to www.elcojacobs.com/shiftpwm for documentation, fuction reference and schematics.
 * If you want to use ShiftPWM with LED strips or high power LED's, visit the shop for boards.

// ShiftPWM uses timer1 by default. To use a different timer, before '#include <ShiftPWM.h>', add

// #define SHIFTPWM_USE_TIMER3  // for Arduino Micro/Leonardo (Atmega32u4)

// Clock and data pins are pins from the hardware SPI, you cannot choose them yourself if you use the hardware SPI.
// Data pin is MOSI (Uno and earlier: 11, Leonardo: ICSP 4, Mega: 51, Teensy 2.0: 2, Teensy 2.0++: 22) 
// Clock pin is SCK (Uno and earlier: 13, Leonardo: ICSP 3, Mega: 52, Teensy 2.0: 1, Teensy 2.0++: 21)

// You can choose the latch pin yourself.

// You can enable the option below to shift the PWM phase of each shift register by 8 compared to the previous.
// This will slightly increase the interrupt load, but will prevent all PWM signals from becoming high at the same time.

// Here you set the number of brightness levels, the update frequency and the number of shift registers.

// Choose them wisely and use the PrintInterruptLoad() function to verify your load.
// There is a calculator on my website to estimate the load.
